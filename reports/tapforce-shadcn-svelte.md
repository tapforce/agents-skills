## Test Summary

A complete SvelteKit website was built following the skill's instructions, consisting of a Welcome page, About page, Contact page, and a shared layout with navigation header and footer. Components used: Button, Card, Input, Label, Separator, Textarea, Badge. The project built and rendered successfully with zero errors.

### Re-test (Post-Fix) Summary

All 5 weaknesses identified in the initial test were fixed directly in the skill source files. A fresh SvelteKit project was created and built from scratch following the corrected skill documentation. All import patterns, component exports, CLI commands, and CSS variable documentation now match the actual shadcn-svelte v1.1.1 behavior. Build completed with zero errors.

---

## Strengths

1. **Comprehensive component list**: The SKILL.md provides a thorough listing of all available shadcn-svelte components with links to official documentation.

2. **CLI-first approach (cli-usage rule)**: The rule correctly emphasizes using CLI commands for initialization and component installation, and the actual `pnpm dlx shadcn-svelte@latest init` and `add` commands work correctly with the documented options.

3. **Clear init configuration options**: The installation section documents all CLI flags clearly (`--base-color`, `--css`, aliases, etc.), making non-interactive setup possible.

4. **Accurate CSS variables documentation**: The theming section now accurately documents the CSS variable values generated by `init --base-color slate`, including the `@theme inline` block, `@import "tw-animate-css"`, `@custom-variant dark` directive, and `@layer base` styles.

5. **Dark mode guidance**: The mode-watcher integration instructions with both simple toggle and dropdown menu examples are practical and well-structured.

6. **Component-usage rule**: Good guidance on leveraging built-in variants (`variant`, `size`, `class` props) with accurate component export names and proper namespace import patterns for complex components.

7. **Component-maintenance rule**: The core principle of not modifying shadcn components directly is sound and well-explained, with import examples now consistent with the component-imports rule.

8. **Consistent import patterns across rules**: All rules now use folder-path imports (e.g., `from "$lib/components/ui/button"`) without `/index.js` suffixes, and each component is imported from its own folder.

9. **Verified component exports**: All component import examples (Select, Checkbox, Field, NavigationMenu, DropdownMenu) now use verified export names matching actual shadcn-svelte v1.1.1 output.

10. **Successful build**: Following the skill's instructions, the project built and ran without errors on both initial and re-test runs.

## Fixed Weaknesses (from initial test)

### 1. ~~Incorrect Multi-Component Import Examples~~ (FIXED)
- **Details**: [incorrect-multi-component-import](tapforce-shadcn-svelte/weaknesses/incorrect-multi-component-import.md)
- **Fix**: All import examples in `component-imports.md` now correctly import each component from its own folder path. Fixed 4 locations where Button, Input, Label were incorrectly imported from a single path.

### 2. ~~Rule Contradiction: index.js File Path~~ (FIXED)
- **Details**: [rule-contradiction-index-js](tapforce-shadcn-svelte/weaknesses/rule-contradiction-index-js.md)
- **Fix**: Changed `component-maintenance.md` imports from `"$lib/components/ui/button/index.js"` and `"$lib/utils.js"` to folder paths `"$lib/components/ui/button"` and `"$lib/utils"`, consistent with the `component-imports` rule.

### 3. ~~CSS Variables Do Not Match Actual Init Output~~ (FIXED)
- **Details**: [css-variables-mismatch](tapforce-shadcn-svelte/weaknesses/css-variables-mismatch.md)
- **Fix**: Replaced incorrect achromatic oklch values with actual slate base color values. Added documentation for `@theme inline` block, `@import "tw-animate-css"`, `@custom-variant dark` directive, and `@layer base` styles.

### 4. ~~NavigationMenu Export Name Does Not Exist~~ (FIXED)
- **Details**: [navigation-menu-wrong-export](tapforce-shadcn-svelte/weaknesses/navigation-menu-wrong-export.md)
- **Fix**: Changed NavigationMenu examples to use namespace import pattern `import * as NavigationMenu from "$lib/components/ui/navigation-menu"` with `<NavigationMenu.Root>` usage.

### 5. ~~Unverified Component Sub-Exports~~ (FIXED)
- **Details**: [unverified-component-exports](tapforce-shadcn-svelte/weaknesses/unverified-component-exports.md)
- **Fix**: Verified and corrected all component exports. Changed `FieldInput` to `FieldContent`, Select to namespace import pattern, removed fake `CheckboxBox`/`CheckboxLabel` exports and replaced with `Checkbox` + separate `Label`.

---

## Remaining Minor Observations

1. **No live verification of all 88 listed components**: Only a subset of components were tested. The component list links are assumed correct based on official shadcn-svelte docs.

2. **`mode-watcher` instructions not build-tested**: Dark mode toggle examples were reviewed but not included in the test build since mode-watcher is an optional addition.

---

## Improvements Applied

1. **All import examples verified** against actual installed component `index.ts` files.
2. **Internal rule consistency achieved**: All rules now use the same import patterns (folder paths, no `/index.js`).
3. **CSS variables section rewritten** with actual slate base color values and complete documentation of generated CSS structure.
4. **Namespace imports recommended** for complex components (NavigationMenu, Select) to avoid export name guessing.
5. **SKILL.md import guidelines updated** to explicitly state each component must be imported from its own folder.
