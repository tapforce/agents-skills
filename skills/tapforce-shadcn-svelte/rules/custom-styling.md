**ALWAYS** respect TailwindCSS v4 rules and features when customizing styles (colors, spacing, etc.).

**ALWAYS** follow shadcn-svelte theming documentation from https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/theming for custom styling.

**NEVER** use legacy TailwindCSS patterns or syntax that conflicts with v4 features.

**ALWAYS** use CSS Variables for theming as recommended by shadcn-svelte documentation.
