**ALWAYS** reference https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/docs/components to find matching components that can be used for user requests.

**NEVER** try to create custom components too early without first checking if shadcn-svelte provides a suitable built-in component.

**ALWAYS** explore the full component library before suggesting custom implementations.
